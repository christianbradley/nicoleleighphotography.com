    <title>Nicole Leigh Photography</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Coming from a family of artists Nicole was destined to become one herself.  In high school, she began taking black and white photography courses, as well as assisting for a local wedding photographer.  By the time she went to college, she was shooting as a documentary style second photographer.  Over the years, her love for the art grew and she has developed her own personal style, one that is certainly different from the normal wedding photographer.  Twelve years of experience in this field gives Nicole the technical knowledge she needs to make her visions a reality." />
