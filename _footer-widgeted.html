                        <p>Every person is beautiful in their own way. Sometimes what makes a person beautiful is not the obvious things that one would notice at a glance. I make it my goal to find what makes each person beautiful, whether it be a personality trait, a mannerism, or simply a smile and then capture that beauty in my images.</p>
